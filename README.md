Skincare Product Search Task

The json file “MeNow_product_task” contains an array of images.
Each object in the array has:
*a link to an image - “path”
*list of relevant keywords - “keywords”
*a score value for the product in the image - “score”
*an index - “id”
Please create a web application that will have the following features:
1. Presenting random 5 images that will change upon clicking a button
2. Image search by a keyword - presenting the best 5 images (if available) sorted by their
scoring.
The access to the data will be done on the client side using an api which you will implement
on the server side.
Technologies:
Client end - React
Server end - Node.js
You are welcome to use additional libraries - explain what you used it for and why.
Bonus:
Implement a function that will change the scoring of the product and will be updated in the
json file.
